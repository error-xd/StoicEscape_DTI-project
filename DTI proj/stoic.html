          <h1>STOICISM</h1>
          <h3>What is Stoicism ?</h3>
          <p>
            Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished in
            Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The Stoics believed that the
            practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived
            life. The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life
            spent practicing the four virtues in everyday life: wisdom, courage,
            temperance or moderation, and justice, and living in accordance with
            nature. It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by Zeno of
            Citium around 300 BC. Alongside Aristotle's ethics, the Stoic
            tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue
            ethics. The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is
            the only good" for human beings, and that external things, such as
            health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves
            (adiaphora) but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".
            Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because
            "virtue is sufficient for happiness", a sage would be emotionally
            resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain
            destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they
            believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis)
            that is "in accordance with nature". Because of this, the Stoics
            thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not
            what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life,
            one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they
            believed everything was rooted in nature.
